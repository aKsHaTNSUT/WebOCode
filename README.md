Hello Judges,
I am Akshat Srivastava,a fresher from NSUT,along with my Teammate Ayush Chaudhary,also from NSUT had registred for the event but could not find ourselves in the team list.
As told,we will be submitting this file to let you know we are very much interested in learning Web Development with you under the IEEE NSUT.
We would also like to convey our ideas regarding the E-sports theme of the event(Judges Please Note:We are not sure if our ideas would be easy to implement,but it's our picture of how the website would be.)
The website would be a single page website with text over black background theme,with infusions of red and white colors wherever appropriate.
A header tab containing hyperlinks to:
1)"Info" 
about the E-sport company
2)"Products"
a drop down menu to our games and equipment
3)"News"
a hyperlink to latest news/updates regarding the games hosted by our company
4)"Sign Up/Login"
for users to sign in their account and setup/edit their profile and much more

Below the header will be our Name.
Below that would a multislide thumbnail hyperlink to all our games along with a play/buy button containing a hyperlink to download/purchase page for the game.The slides will playing a short high resolution monatge of the games one by one,which should be captivating enough for the users over the given background color.
On the side we could run a updates/news columns with running text regarding the same.It would be same content as the aforesaid "News" tab.

The bottom most panel would include hyperlinks to our:
1)Help/Support
2)Privacy Policy
3)Terms of Service

This is the layout we have in mind but as we dont know the implementation,the feasability of this site is unknown.
It would mean a lot if considered teaching us in the near future.
Thank You.
